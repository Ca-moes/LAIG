\section{Startup}

\textbf{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SICStus Prolog
    \item Mozilla Firefox (yes, it \textbf{should} be this browser, for some reason, chromium-based browsers are not working properly with the prolog server)
    \item An HTTP Web Server provider
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Execute SICStus Prolog;
    \item Consult \verb+server.pl+ on \verb+./prolog_connection/+;
    \item Start the server, executing '\verb+server.+' on SICStus Console;
    \item Start the Application using an HTTP Web Server on your local machine serving a directory containing \verb+lib+ folder and \verb+TP3+ folder.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The server will be running on the background, so, unless the user closes the server, it will be receiving 
requests on port 8081.
This means closing the browser tab \textbf{won't} shutdown the server.\\
\noindent These are the only mandatory requirements and procedures to startup the application, the details about starting a game and using the in-game controls
will be exposed on the next section.
