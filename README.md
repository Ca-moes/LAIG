### [TP1 - Scene Graph](TP1)

- Strong Points
  - Our scene is based on a real place;
  - Precision to two decimal values on component position to avoid clipping and maintain realism;
  - Our parser is being developed to give the user the maximum information possible about an error or minor error, making the debugging process effortless; 
- Scene;
  - Our scene consists on an *Izakaya*, a type of informal Japanese bar which serves alcoholic drinks and snacks. Izakayas are casual places for after-work drinking, similar to Irish pubs, Spanish tapas bars, and American saloons and taverns.(wikipedia);
